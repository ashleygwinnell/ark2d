TODO:
- TextField work:
 - use mouse to select text.
 - use mouse to select cursor/caret position.
 - use keyboard to select text.
  - using control-shift left.
- Alter Transitions so that enter() is called before render() - this should mostly deprecate the use of manual initFromState()s.
- Add Math / Triangulation classes.
- Draw Mouse image at screen refresh rate instead of per-update-render-cycle for smooth mouse rendering.
- Functionality for Gamepad Analog sticks and Triggers.
- Functionality for when a Gamepad is plugged in after the game is started.
- Functionality for mapping Gamepad keys directly to keyboard keys for quick testing and somewhat cleaner code.
- Standardise MathUtil::angle to start from right and go clockwise.
-- Means Image rotation standard should be 270 or -90.
