28/03/14 1.03.03 - Studio API patch release (build 52338)
----------------------------------------------------

Fixes:
* Studio API   - Fixed Studio::EventDescription::getInstanceCount and
                 Studio::EventDescription::getInstanceList incorrectly providing
                 data for all events in the bank, not just the queried event.
* Studio API   - Added Studio::EventDescription::loadSampleData,
                 Studio::EventDescription::unloadSampleData and
                 Studio::EventDescription::getSampleLoadingState to C# wrapper.

26/03/14 1.03.02 - Studio API patch release
----------------------------------------------------

Features:
* Studio API   - Added Studio::EventDescription::loadSampleData,
                 Studio::EventDescription::unloadSampleData and
                 Studio::EventDescription::getSampleLoadingState functions.
* LowLevel API - Added FMOD_ChannelGroup_IsPlaying to C API.

Fixes:
* Studio API   - Fix for setting parameter values that could cause volume
                 changes without the appropriate volume ramp.
* LowLevel API - Fix for some incorrect declarations in the C header files.
* LowLevel API - Fixed a linker error when calling some C API functions.
* LowLevel API - Fixed FMOD_ChannelGroup_AddGroup not returning the DSP
                 connection on success.

18/03/14 1.03.01 - Studio API patch release
---------------------------------------------------

Important:
* LowLevel API - Blocking commands are not allowed to be called from the low level 
                 non-blocking callback.  Attempting to do so will log an error 
                 and return FMOD_ERR_INVALID_THREAD.  See FMOD_SOUND_NONBLOCK_CALLBACK
                 for more information.

Fixes:
* Studio API   - Fixed simple nested events not terminating properly when inside
                 multi sounds
* LowLevel API - Fix SRS downmix crash on startup if software mixer was set to 5.1, 
                 and the OS was set to stereo, and the system sample rate was not 
                 44/48/96khz
* LowLevel API - Fix for deadlock that could occur when executing commands in the
                 non-blocking callback as another thread is releasing sounds.
* LowLevel API - Fix for Channel::getPosition and ChannelControl::getDSPClock 
                 returning errors when called on emulated channels created with 
                 System::playDSP.
* LowLevel API - PS4 - Fixed leak of audio output handles on shutdown.
* LowLevel API - Fix crash in compressor when placed on a channel with a delay.

Notes:
* PS4 - Now built with SDK 1.600.071.


03/03/14 1.03.00 - Studio API minor release
----------------------------------------------------

Important:
* Added PS Vita platform support.
* Updated FMOD Studio Programmers API documentation.
* Studio API   - Changed .bank file format - ALL BANKS MUST BE REBUILT 
* Studio API   - Studio API is now asynchronous by default, with the processing
                 occuring on a new Studio thread.  Asynchronous behaviour can be
                 disabled with the FMOD_STUDIO_INIT_SYNCHRONOUS_UPDATE init flag.
* Studio API   - Studio API classes are now all referenced as pointers.  This
                 reflects a change in the handle system to make it thread-safe,
                 more performant and match the C and low level interface.
* Studio API   - Event and mixer strip paths now include a prefix in order to 
                 guarantee uniqueness. See Studio::System::lookupID.
* LowLevel API - Low Level is now thread-safe by default.  Thread safety can be 
                 disabled with the FMOD_INIT_THREAD_UNSAFE init flag. 
* LowLevel API - Codecs must set waveformatversion to FMOD_CODEC_WAVEFORMAT_VERSION
                 in the FMOD_CODEC_OPEN_CALLBACK.
* LowLevel API - Removed support for digital CD audio

Features:
* Studio API   - The new .bank file format provides improved support for backward 
                 and forward compatibility. Future version updates will not 
                 generally require banks to be rebuilt.
* Studio API   - Added support for events duplicated across banks.
* Studio API   - Added support for transition marker and loop region probability.
* Studio API   - Added support for sounds on transition timelines.
* Studio API   - Added asset enumeration functions: Studio::System::getBankCount,
                 Studio::System::getBankList, Studio::Bank::getEventCount,

                 Studio::Bank::getMixerStripList.
* Studio API   - Added path retrieval functions: Studio::System::lookupPath, 
                 Studio::EventDescription::getPath, Studio::MixerStrip::getPath, 
                 Studio::Bank::getPath.
* Studio API   - Bank loading now takes an extra flags argument.  It is possible
                 to load banks in non-blocking mode in which case the function
                 will return while the bank is still in the process of loading.
* Studio API   - Added Studio::System::setAdvancedSettings.
* Studio API   - Added Studio::System::getCPUUsage.
* Studio API   - Studio repositories have improved performance and no longer depend
                 on the standard library map.
* LowLevel API - The system callback now includes the error callback type which
                 will be invoked whenever a public FMOD function returns a result
                 which is not FMOD_OK.
* LowLevel API - Optimize Sound::getNumSyncPoints when using large FSB files with 
                 many subsounds and many syncpoints. 
* LowLevel API - Made improvements to virtual voices for DSP graphs using sends, 
                 returns, fade points, and sounds with varying peak volumes.
* LowLevel API - PS4 - Added recording support.
* LowLevel API - XBox One - Added dll loading support.
* FSBank API   - Added support for exporting peak volume per sound using the 
                 FSBANK_BUILD_WRITEPEAKVOLUME flag.

                 the userdata specified in System::setUserData.
* LowLevel API - Xbox One - APU allocations are now handled internally for developers
                            using memory callbacks or memory pools.

                 an event instance is already stopped.
* Studio API   - Fixed Studio::EventInstance::getCueCount returning 1 even on events 
                 with no sustain points.
* LowLevel API - Fixed ChannelControl::setDelay rarely being ignored. 

Notes:

                 of breaking the reads up into 16kb chunks.
* Studio API   - Changed behavior of Studio::EventInstance::getCue to return 
                 FMOD_ERR_EVENT_NOTFOUND if the event has no sustain points.

                 ChannelControl::removeFadePoints, ChannelControl::getFadePoints. 

Features:

                 FMOD_CHANNELCONTROL type is now used for callbacks, and the 
                 user should just cast to the relevant channel or channelgroup
                 type.
* LowLevel API - Fixed fade point interpolation on channels with pitch.

Features:
* PS4 - Added support for mono and stereo AT9 FSBs.
* LowLevel API - Optimized mixer by about 10%
* LowLevel API - Added 'sends' which is a special type of DSPConnection that
                 does not try and execute the input, the output (return) just 
                 consumes what was generated by the input (the send). See
                 FMOD_DSPCONNECTION_TYPE_SEND

                 FMOD_DSPCONNECTION_TYPE_SIDECHAIN, and FMOD_DSPCONNECTION_TYPE_SEND
                 are now supported.   DSPConnection::getType replaces DSPConnection::isSideChain
